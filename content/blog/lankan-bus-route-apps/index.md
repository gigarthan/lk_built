Finding the correct bus route and train timetables is necessary for a
daily commuter in urban areas of colombo district and other parts of Sri Lanka.
Most of the Apps found in the playstore has terrible User Interface but some of them gets the
job done.

## Colombo Bus Route

Colombo Bus Route has a 4.3 review with 50K+ downloads. This app doesn't follow any material UI guidelines
and has a simple old UI. Eventhough the UI is a bit old, the app gets the job done. Colombo Bus Route opens with a 4 grid buttons with finding bus routes with start to destinations, current place to destination, route number and buses available in our current location.

## Bus Routes Colombo

Bus Routes Colombo app has a newish UI but fails to place the details in a proper way where it would be easy to process at a glance. The app starts with a Start and Destination input with a Map view. Once we select a route we are presented with a bunch of routes with lot of information but the issue is the information is not placed in an easy to readable view for the user. Lot more information is presented in this app than the previous one but it doesn't matter if the user feels like all the information is just dumped on the screen.

## SLBG

SLBG is a decent app with lot of information of routes, buses and fares. It has all the information you'll need. In terms of UI, it doesn't has any pleasant UI experience but a decent one. Basically it gets the job done. It might take a little time to load all the data so patience is a necessary when using this app.
